# GenAI_LLM
Repository containing example Jupyter notebooks provided by Coursera's Generative AI with LLM for their 3 labs. 

## Course Information
In Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs), youâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of how generative AI works, and how to deploy it in real-world applications. The main LLM model used in this course is FLAN-T5, a model released by Google which is an instructioned fine-tuned version of T-5 Model (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer), based on > 1800 language tasks, with increased reasoning skills and promptability.
